# Visual Low-Code App Builder

## Overview

The **Visual Low-Code App Builder** is a web-based tool that allows users to create applications visually by dragging and connecting components and logic nodes. The builder outputs a JSON configuration of the designed app, which can be dynamically compiled into a Next.js project for live previews and deployment.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Editor**: Create and arrange components on a visual canvas.
- **UI and Logic Nodes**: Combine visual components like buttons and headers with logic nodes like conditionals and API calls.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly view the compiled app inside a preview pane.
- **Export to Next.js**: Download the generated app as a complete Next.js project in a `.zip` file.

   cd visual-low-code-builder
   -   Install dependencies:

    ```bash

    `npm install`

    -   Run the development server:
    ```

    ```

    -   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

    Usage
-----

### Designing Applications

1.  Use the **Sidebar** to drag and drop components and logic nodes onto the **Canvas**.
2.  Connect nodes using wires to define data and signal flows.
3.  Adjust properties of components using the settings panel (to be added in future versions).

### Live Preview

-   View a live preview of your app in the **Preview Pane** as you make changes on the canvas.

### Exporting Applications

1.  Click the **Export** button to generate a `.zip` file containing a Next.js project.
2.  Extract the `.zip` file and navigate to the folder.
3.  Install dependencies and start the project:

    ```bash

    `npm install
    npm run dev`

    ```

    JSON Structure
--------------

The app builder uses a JSON configuration to define the app. Example:

```json

`{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "My App",
    "description": "A sample app",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "header",
      "props": { "text": "Welcome!", "fontSize": "24px", "align": "center" },
      "position": { "x": 100, "y": 50 }
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "type": "button",
      "props": { "text": "Click Me", "color": "primary", "onClick": "handleClick" },
      "position": { "x": 150, "y": 150 }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "2", "target": "1" }
  ],
  "events": {
    "handleClick": "alert('Button clicked!')"
  }
}`
```
